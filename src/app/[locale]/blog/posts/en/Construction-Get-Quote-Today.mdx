## How to Choose the Best Construction Company for Your Investment

Choosing a general contractor should not be taken lightly. During the **customer journey**, it’s crucial to evaluate not only cost but also the technical capacity and moral solvency of the company. The best **construction companies in Aguascalientes** stand out for three fundamental pillars:

1. **Proven Experience:** Verifiable history in similar projects (industrial warehouses, vertical housing, or public works).
2. **Technology and Management:** Use of project management software to keep the client informed.
3. **Legality and Regulations:** Strict compliance with local and federal construction standards.

### The Importance of a Visible Digital Portfolio

Nowadays, trust is built visually. A key factor for investors is the ability to research brands and services through robust digital platforms. The leading construction companies are those that showcase their work flawlessly online.

* **Pre-project and Budget:** Full transparency in unit costs.
* **Construction Schedule:** Real timelines with penalties for delays.
