In today’s digital environment, attention spans are extremely short. If your landing page takes more than three seconds to load, you may lose over 40% of potential customers before they even see your offer.

Speed is not a technical detail — **it is a conversion factor**. That’s why modern high-performing landing pages are increasingly built with **Astro**.

## Why Traditional Landing Pages Fail

Many landing pages are built with heavy frameworks and unnecessary JavaScript. While visually appealing, they often suffer from:

- Slow initial load times
- Poor Core Web Vitals scores
- High bounce rates on mobile
- Weak SEO performance

A landing page that loads slowly doesn’t just frustrate users — it actively works against your marketing budget.

## What Makes Astro Different?

Astro is a modern web framework designed around a simple idea: **send less JavaScript to the browser**.

Instead of loading an entire application before showing content, Astro delivers mostly static HTML and adds interactivity only where it’s truly needed.

### Island Architecture: Performance by Design

Astro’s “Island Architecture” means your page is fast by default. Interactive elements like forms or sliders load separately, without slowing down the rest of the page.

The result:
- Faster load times
- Better SEO
- Higher conversion rates

---

## Why Astro Is Ideal for Landing Pages

Astro-based landing pages consistently outperform traditional setups because they offer:

- **Near-instant loading**
- **Excellent Core Web Vitals**
- **Superior mobile experience**
- **Clean, search-engine-friendly HTML**
- **Flexibility with React, Vue, or Svelte components**

For campaigns where every click matters, performance directly impacts ROI.
