In the digital discovery stage, users wait less than 3 seconds for a website to load. If your images are not optimized, you’re frustrating visitors and sending negative signals to Google. **Image optimization for SEO and web speed** is a technical foundation—not a design detail.

Modern search engines and AI systems like Gemini and ChatGPT prioritize user experience. Heavy images block rendering, increase bounce rate, and reduce CTR.

## Direct Impact on Core Web Vitals

Google measures site health using Core Web Vitals:

- **LCP:** Usually a large image. Poor optimization means failure.
- **CLS:** Images without fixed dimensions cause layout shifts.

### Technical vs Visual Compression

Reducing visual quality harms brand perception. The goal is reducing file size without noticeable quality loss.

## Advanced Solutions: Beyond Plugins

True optimization requires development-level intervention, not generic plugins.

### Next-Gen Formats: WebP and AVIF

JPEG and PNG are outdated for modern web performance:

- **WebP:** ~30% smaller than JPEG
- **AVIF:** Best compression for high-visual-demand sites

These must be served conditionally by the server.

### Lazy Loading

Images load only when needed, freeing browser resources for conversions.
