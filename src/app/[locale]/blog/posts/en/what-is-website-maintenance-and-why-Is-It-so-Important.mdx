Many times we may think of our software application as a product we can simply buy and let it generate benefits for our business just by having it on the Internet. From advertising for our business to online sales, the benefits may seem endless. However, a website is like a child: it not only needs to be conceived and developed, but it also requires ongoing maintenance for as long as we want the site to stay active.

Itâ€™s enough to say that a web page is not something tangible we can touch with the palm of our hands; rather, it is a complex entity living on the web. And just the mere fact of hosting it online comes with a cost â€” the so-called hosting fee. On top of this, there are additional expenses such as the domain, which can be understood as the name of our site. Because yes, having a name on the web comes at a price.

Nevertheless, beyond the fundamental costs of keeping our site online, we must keep in mind that the site requires constant maintenance. This allows it not only to stay up to date with market trends but also to adapt to the changes our business may face.

## But... What Is Maintenance?

Just as a vehicle requires regular visits to the mechanic to ensure it is working properly â€” and, if it isnâ€™t, to fix it immediately before something serious happens â€” we must monitor the health of our website. This is not only to make sure everything is running smoothly, but also to correct it when it isnâ€™t.

Sometimes a visit to the mechanic isnâ€™t only to prevent damage. We might also be interested in giving our vehicle some improvements â€” maybe replacing the carâ€™s headlights with new ones or adjusting a part. In the same way, we may occasionally want to do a rebranding, which usually involves changes to colors and iconography, and of course, it would be nice to see those changes reflected on our site.

## Very Nice and All, but... What If I Donâ€™t Do It?

We can choose to drive a car without ever taking it to the mechanic, but the consequences will show up sooner rather than later. Just as our car may break down in the middle of the street, not taking responsibility for our websiteâ€™s maintenance could mean it ends up indefinitely offline due to some complex error we donâ€™t understand.

Itâ€™s not just an aesthetic matter. We must keep in mind that a website may work perfectly at a given moment, but the environment where it is hosted is highly variable, and itâ€™s to be expected that external factors will affect our site in one way or another. Perhaps our site is perfect for 100 users visiting at the same time, but eventually that traffic may grow. Thatâ€™s good at first, but suddenly our site may struggle to handle hundreds of thousands of visitors at once â€” which ironically could make us lose them if we donâ€™t do something about it.

## Can Software 3S Help Me with My Maintenance?

The short answer is: Absolutely! At Software 3S we are committed to respecting the lifecycle of a project as if it were a baby. We wonâ€™t let anything bad happen to it, and weâ€™ll always seek whatâ€™s best for its growth.
