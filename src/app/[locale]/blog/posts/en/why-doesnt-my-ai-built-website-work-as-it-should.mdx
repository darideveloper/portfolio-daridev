In recent months, weâ€™ve seen a surge in the use of AI tools to automate processes that we once thought impossible. Itâ€™s no longer far-fetched to think there might be an AI that can help us with almost any task, from the most mundane to the most complex aspects of our business.

AI presents itself as an alternative that ranges from free options to surprisingly affordable subscription costs. However, this also raises many questions.

## Can I build my project using only AI?

Across different social media platforms, IT gurus promote tutorials on how to create software applications using only AI, attempting to eliminate the need for a development team. Itâ€™s cheap, itâ€™s easyâ€”so why not give it a try?

While AI can help guide our objectives and focus our efforts on the different tasks involved in developing our application, thereâ€™s still the key question: do we actually know everything necessary to say our application is complete? I could easily ask ChatGPT right now to write me an article on entropic gravity without knowing a single thing about physics, and our obliging friend would deliver it in seconds. Would I understand it? Most likely not. Is what ChatGPT says correct? I have no idea. How could I correct something I donâ€™t understand?

## AI as a tool to enhance our skills

When we know exactly what we need, tools like ChatGPT or Gemini become truly powerful. Itâ€™s not just that they generate content, but if we understand what theyâ€™re generating, we can correct it or even improve it.

Often our applications donâ€™t stop at a first version. Before long, we may want to add a new feature or fix a small bug in our system. If our site was built with AI, we might end up with something spectacular, but without really knowing how it works under the hood. If we need to add a simple button, where should we put it? And even if AI tells us where, how do we know weâ€™re not moving something we shouldnâ€™t? Suddenly, you enter your site only to find the terrifying scenario that every element has shifted around, leaving you with a chaotic patchwork of misplaced components.

## What can I do as a non-technical user?

This issue goes beyond simply wanting to update or improve your website. There are well-established practices and standards that make the development and maintenance of a web application a smoother experience. When someone is unfamiliar with these paths, itâ€™s highly likely theyâ€™ll get lost.

As developers, our job is not only to write complex code, but also to listen to you and understand exactly what could solve the problem you present, even telling you whether itâ€™s feasible within a given budget. Thatâ€™s why the Software 3S team is committed to guiding you through the digital world without forcing you to face the technical challenges that come with managing a site built only with AI.
