Having a website can be the first big step toward business success, but it can’t be the last. It’s not enough to have an attractive site given the incredible amount of competition online, because having the best site is useless if no one can find it. It’s only a matter of thinking about all the sites that offer a solution similar to yours — what makes your site stand out above the rest? Many might think the answer lies in the internal workings of the page, but the truth is that if a user decides to search for something related to your site, what guarantees that it won’t end up buried among hundreds of search results? The answer is simple: SEO.  

## But... What Is SEO?

SEO, or *Search Engine Optimization*, is a set of techniques applied to a website to make it appear among the top search engine results in a free and organic way. In short, it’s the art of giving your site visibility so that more people can discover it.

When a site is optimized for SEO, it’s more likely to appear in the top search results, allowing potential customers to be drawn to your website without having to scroll through hundreds of links.

## Interesting... But Does It Mean an Extra Cost?

We’ve all seen those pages that appear at the top of search results even when we were explicitly looking for a different site — the so-called “sponsored” pages. Anyone can pay to make their site show up artificially in searches for certain terms, but few can achieve that naturally and without extra costs.

A good SEO strategy means being able to create a website from the start with best practices in mind, ensuring strong online positioning without the need for additional expenses; it’s only a matter of having a quality development team that can guarantee good SEO.
