## Project Description

**Moonhouse** is a **custom-designed landing page** created with **Astro**, intended to serve as the **digital business card** for a restaurant. The project is based on a design provided in Figma, with the primary objective of replicating it **down to the last pixel**. As a *Single Page Application* (SPA), all crucial information—from the dishes and gallery to contact details—is contained on a single page, optimizing user experience and navigation. The site is designed to be completely dynamic, with a **custom backend in Directus** that will allow the client to easily update content without needing to edit the code.

---

## **Key Features**

* **Design Fidelity to Figma:** The project focuses on the **exact replication of the design** provided by the client, ensuring that the aesthetics and user experience are identical to the original vision.
* **Dynamic Content Management:** The site's content, such as dishes, the gallery, and contact information, will be managed through a **custom dashboard in Directus**. This gives the client _total control_ over the information without depending on a developer for every change.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** The key sections of the page (gallery, dishes, contact information, and hours) are rendered on the server, using data obtained from the **Directus API**. This ensures that content is available immediately, improving **performance** and **loading speed**.
* **Comprehensive SEO and Metadata:** A robust metadata strategy will be implemented, including **HTML meta tags, Open Graph, JSON-LD, and Twitter Cards**, to improve search engine ranking and visibility when shared on social media.
* **Multi-language:** The site will have support for **English and Spanish**, allowing the restaurant to reach a wider audience.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**

* **Astro:** The main framework for the landing page development.
* **React:** Used alongside Astro for creating interactive components.
* **Tailwind CSS and Sass:** For modular and efficient styling, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
* **AOS (Animate On Scroll):** For scroll animations, adding a dynamic and attractive touch to the user experience.
* **Swiper:** For creating the image gallery and other carousel sections.
* **External Fonts:** Fonts from Fontsource (`Dancing Script`, `Montserrat`, `Plus Jakarta Sans`) will be used to accurately replicate the typography of the design.
* **React Icons:** For the icons used in the interface.

### **Backend and CMS**

* **Directus:** The headless content management platform that will provide the API to update the page's information.

## **Challenges and Learnings**

* **Design Fidelity:** The main challenge is to replicate the Figma design with **pixel-perfect accuracy**, which requires meticulous attention to spacing, typography, and layout details.
* **Backend Integration:** Connecting Astro with the **Directus API** to serve content dynamically, ensuring that data is rendered correctly and updates in real-time.
* **Performance Optimization:** Despite being an SPA, it is crucial to ensure the page loads quickly, especially with the **dynamic content** that will be fetched from the API.
* **Dynamic Metadata Strategy:** Implementing the logic for metadata to be generated automatically and correctly, based on the API content, which is essential for effective **SEO** on a single-page site.
