## Project Description

**Guía de Inmigración** is a **_multi-page_** web project developed for a legal consultancy specializing in immigration services between Mexico and the United States. The website is designed to **guide individuals with dual lives between both countries**, especially U.S. citizens living in Mexico, and to **facilitate the process of reclaiming their legal identity**. The site's structure aims to **build trust** through the experience of the founder and the team, positioning Guía de Inmigración as a **_reliable partner for a borderless legal journey_**. This project demonstrates our ability to create **informative and accessible websites for legal consulting firms**, with various sections to **present their services and their commitment to family reunification**.
